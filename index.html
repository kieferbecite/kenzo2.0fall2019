  <h3 style="text-align:center;">About</h3>
  <p>A progressive, yet simplistic approach executed from a deep history of Kyo-Kaiseki and Edomae style omakase. Two of Japan’s historical culinary concepts brought together combining seasonal ingredients and only the highest  premium fish selections direct from our private fish purveyor from the world renown Toyosu fish market in Tokyo, Japan. Kenzo 2.0’s main goal is to exemplify its word class japanese cuisine and share its unique spin on the classic omakase style of Japanese cuisine. 
Our monthly tasting menu is based on our precision to detail and the execution of our course by course experience delivered by our world renowned chefs. Through these dishes, which are made special for each customer, you are able to discover and experience Japan’s prominent culture. It all starts with our commitment to bring only the freshest and highest grade ingredients to your plate every night. We take into consideration the seasons when choosing which ingredients will be served each night and how these ingredients will compliment the fish of choice.
Kenzo 2.0 of San Jose embodies the spirit derived from its original location in Tokyo, Japan. Careful selection of seasonal components and traditional cooking techniques define each course as they tell a story of Japan’s bountiful culinary history. Executive chef Max Nguyen pays homage by implementing his signature dashi as the foundation of expressing the season’s highlighted ingredients. Our executive chef then meticulously prepares the day’s catch from hand selected fish caught in Japan’s famous waters.
Our mission is to be a luxury dining destination for the city of San Jose and a staple by maintaining our commitment to quality, sound execution and excellent service. We look forward to having you dine with us.

        <h2>Justin Cho</h2>
        <p class="title">Owner</p>
        <p>Justin Cho was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah. Throughout Justin’s childhood he was never exposed to Japanese food. This all changed when he vacationed to beautiful San Jose and he stumbled upon the Kenzo’s sushi restaurant. He instantly fell in love with their California roll. Ever since his visit to San Jose, Justin’s life changed forever. As he returned to Utah, Justin had only one thing on his mind and that was to open up his own Japanese restaurant. He then won the lottery and invested all of his money into making Kenzo 2.0 (not affiliated with the first one). And yes, he only eats California rolls for meals.</p>

        <h2>Max Nguyen</h2>
        <p class="title">Executive Chef</p>
        <p>Max Nguyen was born in the depths of the Atlantic Ocean. He was raised by Shark Boy and learned to breathe through gills that he developed through an intense training regimen (we didn’t know this was possible either). Max had always been a curious child, and one day his curiosity got the best of him. Max had always wondered what fish tasted like, but in his school of fish, it was forbidden to eat other fish species. Because of their strict motto “Fish are friends, not food.” One night, Max grew so tired of eating seaweed and kelp and in a furious rage he swallowed up two other fish. To his surprise, he loved the taste of fish. Ever since that night Max had devoted his life to finding the best ways to cook his seafood friends up and create a once in a life-time dining experience for other humans to enjoy.

        <p class="title">Sushi Chef</p>
        <p>Born in the Bermuda Triangle, Kiefer Becite has lived as a Sushi Chef for over 6 years. His passion for cooking is unmatched by anyone in the world. Starting when he was a child, Kiefer was a participant on Gordon Ramsey’s Masterchef Junior where he was kicked off the show for pouring milk before cereal. After being banished from all kitchens in the northern hemisphere, he decided to self-learn by watching cooking tutorials on Youtube. He quickly developed a natural skill for making sushi and began a career making Youtube videos. Averaging over 2 views a month, Justin Cho stumbled upon Kiefer’s videos and instantly offered a full-time, minimum wage position. Since Kiefer’s arrival, Kenzo 2.0’s customer experience has skyrocketed to a peak no other owner could image. Kiefer has been an integral part of Kenzo’s surge in popularity and continues to grow as a lead chef.
